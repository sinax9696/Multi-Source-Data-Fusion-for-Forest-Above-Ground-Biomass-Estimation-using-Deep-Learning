This repository contains the implementation of an integrated deep learning framework for estimating forest Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). The framework combines Sentinel-1 radar, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multispectral imagery, climatic variables, and LiDAR-derived topographic parameters across multiple fusion scenarios.

Several U-Net-based architectures (U-Net3+, TransU-Net, Attention U-Net, etc.) were trained and evaluated in TensorFlow. Results demonstrate the advantage of multi-source fusion and explainable AI (XAI) in improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness across diverse forest conditions.
